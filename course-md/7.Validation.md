# Validation

- https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/validation

## 1 - introduction

- Laravel provides several different approaches to **validate** your application's incoming data. It is most common to use the **validate** method available on all **incoming HTTP requests**. However, we will discuss other **approaches** to **validation** as well.

## 2 - Writing The Validation Logic

- Now we are ready to fill in our store method with the logic to validate the new blog post. To do this, we will use the validate method provided by the **Illuminate\Http\Request** object.

- If the **validation** rules pass, your code will keep executing normally; however, if validation fails, an **Illuminate\Validation\ValidationException** **exception** will be **thrown** and the **proper** error **response** will **automatically** be sent back to the user.
