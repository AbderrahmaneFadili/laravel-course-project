# Views

## 1 - introduction

- Of course, it's not practical to **return** entire **HTML** **documents** **strings** directly from your routes and **controllers**. **Thankfully**, **views** provide a convenient way to place all of our **HTML** in **separate** **files**. **Views** separate your **controller** / **application** **logic** from your **presentation** **logic** and are **stored** in the **resources/views** directory.

## 2 - Creating & Rendering Views

- https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/views#creating-and-rendering-views

- You may create a view by placing a file with the .blade.php extension in your application's **resources/views** directory. The **.blade.php** extension informs the **framework** that the file contains a **Blade template**. **Blade templates** contain **HTML** as well as **Blade** **directives** that allow you to easily echo values, create "**if**" **statements**, **iterate over data**, and more.
